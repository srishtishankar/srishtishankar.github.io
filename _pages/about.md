Master's student in Data Science and Analytics at UT Austin. 

About Me
======
Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems, particularly in areas like data analyctis, data engineering, predictive modeling, natural language processing, and multimodal data integration. 

Currently, I am a Data Science Intern at the Texas Department of Transportation, where I fine-tune large language models like BERT and build multimodal models for crash report classification. Previously, I worked as a Data Engineer at ZS Associates, where I designed and deployed ETL pipelines on AWS and Airflow, streamlined data ingestion workflows, and performed data analysis on commercial clinical data. 

I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from VIT Vellore, where I was an active member of the IEEE Computer Society student chapter. 

My technical toolkit includes *Python*, *SQL*, *AWS*, *Tableau*, *PySpark*, *Snwoflake* and *machine learning frameworks*.

I thrive on creating meaningful insights from data and solving complex real-world challenges. Outside of work and academics, I enjoy a good matcha and some vegan sushi!

Data Analyst with 3+ years of experience and a recent grad from UT Austin. 

About Me
======
Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems, particularly in areas like data analytics, data engineering, business intelligence, and natural language processing.

My technical toolkit includes *Python*, *SQL*, *AWS*, *Tableau*, *PySpark*, *Snwoflake* and *machine learning frameworks*.

I thrive on creating meaningful insights from data and solving complex real-world challenges. Outside of work and academics, I enjoy a good matcha and some vegan sushi!
